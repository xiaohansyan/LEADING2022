Prints and Photographs Division. \\r\\r\\n</div>\\r\\r\\n</div>\\r\\r\\n<p>The Chinese American  community is the largest ethnic group of Asian Americans in the United States.  At the time of the 2010 census, the population stood at around 3.8 million. The  largest Chinese American communities live in California  and New York. </p>\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\n<p>The Chinese were among  the earliest of the Asian peoples to arrive in America;  the first record of Chinese migrants in the United States dates back to 1785. However,  the first major wave of Chinese immigration occurred in the mid-nineteenth  century, following the discovery of gold in California in 1849. During the mid-1800s,  Chinese immigrants were encouraged to come to the United States to work in service  professions that supported the boom towns of the Gold Rush, and to help build  railroads in the West.</p>\\r\\r\\n<p>Between the mid  nineteenth and mid twentieth centuries, most of the Chinese immigrants were  young men from rural backgrounds who only spoke local dialects. The majority  came from the southern Guangdong  region. They brought with them their indigenous musical styles. These included  Cantonese opera and Taishan <em>muyu</em> song, a sub-genre of an important South Chinese narrative song type from the  Taishan region where many of the first immigrants originated, which often  included lyrics about the early Chinese migrant experience. These forms went on  to dominate the Chinese American music scene for more than a century. </p>\\r\\r\\n<p>The Library of Congress  collection includes a recording of a traditional Chinese song, entitled \"<a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/item/ihas.200196394/\">Drum Song of  Fengyang</a>.\"   In this song, which was recorded in San Francisco, California,  by Rulan Chao Pian and Margaret Speaks in August, 1943, a wife complains that her husband is lazy, while the husband  complains that his wife has big feet. The song is well known in China  and many versions exist of comical complaints about family life. But it seems  that this is comedy in the face of adversity, as the song is thought to have originated  in Guandong province as a song sung by refugees of  floods in the north of China who found themselves singing on the street  of cities in Guangdong  province to get money to survive. This  explains why the song is sung in Mandarin, while the language of Guandong is  Cantonese. </p>\\r\\r\\n<p>In 1852, a year after San Francisco experienced  its first full-length Italian opera performance (of Bellini\\'s <em>La Sonnambula</em>) Hong Took Tong Chinese  Dramatic Company from Guangdong Province, a 130-member Cantonese opera troupe,  staged the first Chinese opera in the United States. The following year the  same troupe performed in New York City.</p>\\r\\r\\n<p>Chinese opera, like lion dances, quickly became  emblematic of Chinese American life and a powerful source of community. Not  only did visiting troupes from China  make regular visits to the United    States, but theaters devoted to the art form  also sprang up around the country. In the late 1870s and 1880s; the so-called  \"golden era\" of Chinese theater in America  -- San Francisco  boasted no less than four Cantonese opera venues. </p>\\r\\r\\n<p>During the mid-to-late  nineteenth century, Chinese Americans became the victims of racism. The  anti-Chinese sentiment resulted in the passing by Congress in 1882 of The  Chinese Exclusion Act. Signed into law by President Chester A. Arthur, the Act  created a ten-year moratorium on most Chinese immigration. Although the law as  written allowed for men to send for wives and children from China, the effect was to severely  restrict even this type of immigration. </p>\\r\\r\\n<p>Widespread prejudice and  cultural differences led to the ghettoization of Chinese communities within the  United States.  Cantonese opera aficionados continued to practice their art form isolated in \"Chinatowns\" with little contact with mainstream American  life. </p>\\r\\r\\n<p>The collapse of the nationalist regime on the  Chinese mainland after World War Two and the establishment of the People\\'s  Republic of China  by the Chinese Communist Party in 1949 prevented many Chinese people, including  some five thousand well-educated, upwardly mobile Chinese citizens, from  returning to their homeland. Stranded in the United States,  the intellectual Chinese population propelled the growth of Peking opera (<em>Jingju</em>) in the United   States during the 1950s and 1960s. Peking opera, which is  considered to be the national opera of China and  Taiwan, is sung in Mandarin and generally  features fewer instruments than its Cantonese counterpart. The form was first  brought to the United States by Mei Lan-fang, a  celebrated Chinese opera diva, during her sensational tour in 1930, but it  wasn\\'t until 1951 that a group of Chinese students formed the first Peking  opera club in New York. </p>\\r\\r\\n<p>Even with the reopening of Chinese immigration  after 1943, professional performing groups declined after the mid-twentieth  century and theaters devoted to Cantonese opera performances disappeared after  the 1960s. However, amateur opera clubs continue the tradition to this day in the  urban centers where there is a sizeable Chinese population such as San Francisco and New York.</p>\\r\\r\\n<p>The four commercial recordings below of songs in  Cantonese made in the United States in 1902 and  1903, are thought to be examples of Cantonese Opera, although the titles and  the names of the performers are not known. They were made for distribution  among Cantonese-speaking Americans:   </p>\\r\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\r\\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/jukebox/recordings/detail/id/5777\">Chinese Recording 1902-11-17 </a><a href=\"/item/jukebox.5777\"></a> </li>\\r\\r\\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/jukebox/recordings/detail/id/6973\">Chinese Recording 1903-08-07  part 2</a></li>\\r\\r\\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/jukebox/recordings/detail/id/6972\">Chinese Recording 1903-08-07  part 6</a>  </li>\\r\\r\\n  <li><a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/jukebox/recordings/detail/id/6974\">Chinese Recording 1903-08-10 part  10</a>    </li>\\r\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\r\\n<p>Western instruments (saxophone, electric  keyboard, electric guitar, violin) have been incorporated into the  performance of Cantonese opera both in China and  the United States since the 1920s. These  instruments are played alongside traditional Chinese instruments like the <em>bangu</em> (drum), <em>erhu</em> (low pitched two-string fiddle) <em>yangqin</em> (hammered dulcimer) and <em>houguan</em> (double-reed wind instrument).</p>\\r\\r\\n<p>Speaking English as well  as Chinese, the educated Chinese population strove to break down the boundaries  separating indigenous Chinese culture from the American mainstream. In addition  to serving the Chinese community, the educated class of Chinese Americans gave Peking opera lectures, demonstrations and performances for  non-Chinese American audiences in universities, museums and other public  settings. </p>\\r\\r\\n<p>Peking opera performers  also helped to popularize the older and highly influential Chinese operatic  form of <em>Kunqu</em> in the United   States. <em>Kunqu</em> opera dates  back to the fourteenth century, features literary and archaic texts, mimetic  dancing and the <em>dizi</em> (flute) as the  main accompanying instrument. </p>\\r\\r\\n<p>During the twentieth century,  Chinese culture began to make an impact on American music in the United States. For example, in 1922, the American composer  Charles  Wakefield Cadman (1881-1946) wrote <em>The Willow Wind</em>, a  song cycle based on Chinese themes. And the American composer Samuel Barlow (1892-1982) wrote his <em>Three Songs from  the Chinese</em> in 1924.  </p>\\r\\r\\n<p>The Magnuson Act (also known as the Chinese Exclusion Repeal Act) of 1943  allowed Chinese immigration for the first time since the Chinese Exclusion Act  of 1882, and permitted some Chinese immigrants already living in the United States to become citizens. </p>\\r\\r\\n<p>It was only after the  United States pushed through the 1965 Immigration Act that abolished \"national  origins\" as a reason for allocating immigration quotas, that Chinese immigrants  flooded into the United States. Mao Zedong died in 1976 and by 1983, China  eased restrictions on emigration so that Chinese citizens were able to enter  the United States in even greater numbers. Chinese people from all  walks of life arrived looking to escape the difficulties of life that was the  legacy of Mao Zedong\\'s China. This influx led to a flowering of Chinese  American musical culture in the 1980s and 1990s. </p>\\r\\r\\n<p>Today, the Chinese  American vocal music landscape is extremely diverse. It encompasses such forms  as Chinese operas, Taishan <em>muyu</em>,  choral singing, western orchestral music, Chinese and western pop, hip-hop and  rock music, karaoke and Asian American jazz (primarily an instrumental form). </p>\\r\\r\\n<p>Western classical music  and instruments gained popularity in China in the nineteenth century. The  arrival of educated, cosmopolitan Chinese immigrants in the mid twentieth  century led to the cultivating of a western classical music tradition among the  Chinese American population and a new hybridized Chinese-western repertoire.  Chinese American orchestras and choruses emerged, performing a range of western  and Chinese music. Chinese-born composers, such as Bright Sheng, Chen Yi and  Tan Dun, have developed prominent careers in the United States starting in the  late twentieth century by combining occidental and Asian musical ideas. </p>\\r\\r\\n<p>Chinese American pop  music is similarly hybridized. Well-known Chinese American vocalists include  the rapper Jin (Au Yeung), the  R&#38;B singers Coco Lee and Leehom Wang and singer-songwriter Magdalen Hsu  Lee.<strong> </strong> </p>\\r\\r\\n<p>The organization Music From China was founded in  1984 in New York City with the aim of introducing American audiences to Chinese  music. The Library of Congress collection includes a webcast of  instrumental Chinese music performed by  members of  Music From China:  <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/item/ihas.200196792/\">The Ann Yao Trio:
